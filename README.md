N/L/A/W - Newton Local Area Wargamers

This website was created for the 1st Milestone project (User Centric Frontend Development) for Code Institute's Full Stack Developer course.

User Experience. 

N/L/A/W is is a local tabletop wargames group that started life as a small afterschool club in a local autism collge. 

The club would like to have a presence online outsied of standard social media to allow other hobbiests and wargame enthusiasts to find out more about the club and what they do, as such they opted to commission someone to develop a website to allow them to do this.

Design 

The design process needed to factor in the clubs history, since many of its members were autistic, thanks to its roots in a local autism college. 

The following sites were used to help research requirements for autism friendly design elements. https://www.horlix.com/making-your-autism-friendly-website/ https://overlayfacts.org/blog/digital-accessibility-web-design-for-autism/ https://uxdesign.cc/designing-for-autistic-people-overview-of-existing-research-d6f6dc20710e

Due to this, several iterations of the site were wireframed before a look was settled on with attempts to work to the UK Department of Health guidlines for ASM freindly design as outlined here - https://file.scirp.org/pdf/JSEA_2014022510055814.pdf

While the final design breaks some of the Department of Health recommendations, specifically rules 2 5 and 10, steps have been taken to assist where confusion may occur, such as the inclusion of bounding boxes as several other websites that have been lauded for ASM focused design also use similar techniques. (https://autisticadvocacy.org/ and https://sesameworkshop.org/topics/autism/) overall this finds a balance between a clean design and an autistic friendly one.

Colour Palette. 

The colours were selected to be sympathetic to the user base, using https://paperheartdesign.com/blog/color-palette-peaceful-palettes to help pick out soothing and low contrast colour palletes that could work for some of the user base. Of those presented, I feel the 'Blueberry Bliss' selection gives a reasonable range of tones and colour options.

Typography. 

As with the other design elements, some care was needed around font usage, specifically using san-serif fonts. 
To this end, after browsing fontapir and google fonts I finally settled on Inter and Syne

Future features that would allow for better levels of support include the ability to pick and choose fonts, font background and  colour options, font size and other similar customisation options. 

Images
